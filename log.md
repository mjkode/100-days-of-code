<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Changed my mind, still doing a shopping list app, but "Shopping-list-vanilla-javascript" by W.S. Toh better suites my needs. It uses Windows:LocalStorage to save the data and I've never used LocalStorage in my programming. 

**Notes**: I want to start with LocalStorage and eventually move to a SQL database.

<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: To start, I'm going to build a 100doc tracking app based on a shopping list app. I downloaded and tested 'learning es6, how to code a shopping list' from github. Author is Tyler Potts. 

**Notes**: I like the looks of this app. I plan on starting with a simple list, Then I'll add other functions and limits to make it more inline with the spirit of 100daysofcode rules..
