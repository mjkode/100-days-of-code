**Today's Progress**: To start, I'm going to build a 100doc tracking app based on a shopping list app. I downloaded and tested 'learning es6, how to code a shopping list' from github. Author is Tyler Potts. 

**Thoughts**: I like the looks of this app. I plan on starting with a simple list, Then I'll add other functions and limits to make it more inline with the spirit of 100daysofcode rules..
